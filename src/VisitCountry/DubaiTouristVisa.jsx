                                    Indian citizens who have ordinary passports with EU residence permits, UK residence permits, US green cards, or US visas are eligible for the Dubai visa on arrival. <br />

                                    In such circumstances, they can apply for entrance visas upon arrival which will be valid for 14 days, with the option to renew for a similar period of time. <br />

                                    Required documents – an Indian passport and an EU residence permit, a UK residence permit, a US green card, or a US visa – must have a minimum validity of six months.

                                    It is recommended that the request be lodged at the earliest possible date and at least 16 calendar days before the planned visit. Please note that applications cannot be submitted more than six months before the date of commencement of the planned tour.
                                    <br />
                                    The holder of a valid visa can submit an application for a new visa before the current visa expires

                                    The Visa processing times are variable depending on the category of Visa and your location. It can take around a few weeks to some months.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For the U.S, depending on your individual visa, the processing times differ widely. A temporary, non-immigrant visa can usually be processed much quicker than a permanent visa for immigrants. Your visa should be approved within a few days whether you’re visiting the United States for business or travel. Visas for immigrants, meanwhile, will take 3 to 5 weeks. In this period, you will know if your visa application is accepted or rejected.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For Canada, the application processing time is the period between the receipt of your visa application by IRCC and the final decision to grant your PR visa. The processing time varies for the different immigration programs that the country offers. So, how soon you will get your PR visa depends on the immigration program you have selected to apply for your PR visa.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    The most popular immigration program is the Express Entry system which also has the fastest processing time. The average processing time for the PR visa in 2020 right from the filing of the application to getting the invitation to apply (ITA) from Canadian authorities is 6 months.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    In the other popular immigration program – the Provincial Nominee Program (PNP), the process is almost like the Express Entry program. The only difference being the verification process takes a little longer, this can extend the processing time to about 12 months.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For the Quebec skilled Workers Program (QSWP), a provincial immigration program run by the Quebec province, the processing time is between 12-16 months.

                                    The processing time of the Canadian work permit is solely dependent on the completion of your application and the office at which you have applied. We have found that processing a Canadian Work Permit can take between 1-27 weeks.

                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    Like work permits, Canadian study permit processing time relies largely on the country of residence of the applicant. A Canadian research permit can usually be processed for between 1-16 weeks.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    For Australia, the PR visa takes about 12 to 18 months on average to be processed.
                                </p>
                                <p>
                                    To ensure that your Australian PR visa application is processed on time do not submit an incomplete application. For the smooth processing of your application, make sure you meet the key requirements of the visa application process.
