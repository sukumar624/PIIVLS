            <h2>Cyprus Tourist Visa</h2>
            <p>Cyprus is an island nation located in the Eastern Mediterranean region. The tourist attractions here include long coastlines, beautiful beaches, archaeological sites, museums and castles.</p>

            <p>Cyprus is well-known for its pleasant weather and beautiful beaches, but the island has much more to offer. There are also charming old villages, fascinating ruins, breathtaking mountains, and magnificent, active cities to be found.</p>

            <p>There are two types of tourist visas available in Cyprus:</p>

            <p>Regular short-stay visas allow visitors to stay in Cyprus for up to 90 days within a 180-day period. Within that 180-day period, they might be given for a single or numerous entries.</p>

            <p>Multiple-entry short-stay visas, which can last anywhere from one to five years depending on the purpose of travel. They do, however, only allow the holder to stay in Cyprus for 90 days during any 180-day term during which the visa is valid.</p>

            <p>For tourists wanting to visit the country a tourist visa is required. This is called the short-stay visa and is valid for 90 days.</p>
