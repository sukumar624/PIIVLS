                <h4>Conclusion</h4>

                <p>The American Association of University Women (AAUW) was established in 1881 by 17 people emphasizing women's success and prosperity. The organization has widely extended in the US with 1000 branches and 17,000 supporters. The organization is partnered with 800 US universities. The main agenda of AAUW is to support women financially for research fellowships. The financial aid will be given to the women enrolled for Masters, Doctoral, and Postdoctoral courses in US universities. The amount differs based on the course. Yearly, many women with great ambitions for women's empowerment are availing themselves of scholarships to pursue their education in the US. Women having a great research plan and ideology are supported by the AAUW.</p>
