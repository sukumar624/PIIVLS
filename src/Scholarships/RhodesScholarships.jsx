                                        The Rhodes Trust acceptance rate for the Rhodes scholarship at Oxford University is 0.7%. As the scholarship selection process is rigorous, very few people from the applicants are going to be shortlisted for the Rhodes scholarship. During the 1st and 2nd world wars, the Rhodes scholarships were cut down to Germany.
