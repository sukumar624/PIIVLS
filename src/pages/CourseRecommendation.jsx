                    <h4>Choose the right course to set up your future</h4>
                    <p>
                        Studying abroad is a life-changing event. However, choosing the right course and college is critical to ensuring your future prospects are bright. Countries across the world have opened their doors to international students and the choice now lies with students. With our understanding of the overseas education and career sectors, Y-Axis has the knowledge to help you make the right decision.

                    <h4>Choosing your course</h4>
                    <p>
                        If you are not sure about which course you want to study, you can assess the available courses based on these factors:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Subjects you enjoy learnng
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Skills you want to gain through the course
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        When you are making a comparison between the different colleges that offer your chosen course, use these parameters to make an informed comparison:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>University ranking</li>
                        <li>Start dates of available programs</li>
                        <li>Content of the course</li>
                        <li>Teaching methodology</li>
                        <li>Career prospects for the course</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        You should consider the immigration options of the country in which you want to study. You should also consider the post-study work options especially if you intend to stay back in the country once your course is over. You must also review the placement record of the university you have opted for.
