            <p>
                Stanford University mostly offers need-based financial aid. About 5,000 students get financial aid in different forms at Stanford from internal as well as external sources. The number of scholarships available for international students is very few. In case, you want financial aid from Stanford, you need to specify it beforehand at the time of submitting your admission applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                About 65% of students obtained financial aid, cutting their total cost of attendance. About 46% of students are granted need-based scholarships and grants. To qualify for scholarships, foreign students need to have either a Social Security number (SSN) or an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN). Foreign students are not qualified for student loans or federal assistance from US government agencies. They can, however, avail of fellowships and assistantship positions with work restrictions.
