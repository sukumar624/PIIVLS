            <p>
                There is no possibility of specializing in general engineering. The Manufacturing Engineering Tripos, however, does offer an integrated course in industrial engineering (operations as well as management).
            </p>
            <p>
                Bachelor of Engineering, or BEng, is a full-time program at the University of Cambridge for a period of four years. Provided on campus, the engineering course provides students with analytical, computing skills, and design.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the first two years (Part I), education is provided in fundamentals of engineering, allowing students an option to choose their area of specialization when they commence their third year.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Part II, i.e., third and fourth years, thorough training is provided in their opted discipline.
            </p>
            <p>
                Students need to complete six weeks of industrial experience by the time they finish their third year.
            </p>
            <p>
                The engineering department’s language program for engineers offers specialized language courses at several levels in Chinese, French, German, Japanese, and Spanish.

            </p>
            <p>
                Tier 4 student visa (General) is usually issued to applicants above16 years of age who register in courses of more than six-month duration.
            </p>
