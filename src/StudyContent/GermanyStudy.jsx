                <h2>Post-Study Work Permit in Germany:</h2>

                <p>
                    International students who have completed their education in Germany are eligible to work in the country under Germany's post-study work visa guidelines. This period is in addition to the study duration specified in the German student
                    visa.
                </p>

                <p>
                    To find employment in the field of study, graduates can apply for an extended 18-month post-study work visa or a temporary residence permit. The 18-month timespan starts when the student completes their education in Germany. This allows
                    gaining work experience without restrictions on the type of job you can apply for. &nbsp;
                </p>

                <p>
