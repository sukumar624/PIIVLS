                <h2>Public vs. Private UK Universities</h2>

                <p>
                    Public universities or institutions are nonprofit institutions owned and funded by the state or the government of the UK. Private universities in the United Kingdom are funded privately and have a smaller enrollment population relative
                    to public universities and those specializing in particular fields of education.
                </p>

                <p>However, a lot of private universities work harder to improve the overall student experience.</p>

                <h2>Scholarships for International Students</h2>

                <p>
                    The&nbsp; UK provides financial aid to international students who do not have access to financial resources in terms of education loans and scholarships. The scholarships reduce the burden of studying abroad and lead to better and more
                    rewarding career opportunities for international students. There is always high competition for getting scholarships, so it is always suggested that the students start the procedure 8 – 12 months in advance.
                </p>

                <p>The award offered in the scholarship varies depending on the institutions and enrolled programs. Some research programs provide fully funded scholarships, whereas some cover part of your living expenses.</p>

                <h3>Step-by-Step Guide to Apply for a Scholarship in the UK</h3>

                <p>Step 1: Research the appropriate scholarships available in the UK.</p>

                <p>Step 2: Check if you meet the eligibility criteria</p>

                <p>Step 3: Prepare and gather all the necessary documents like Letters of recommendation, academic records, etc.</p>

                <p>Step 4: Submit the complete application along with the documents.</p>

                <p>Step 5: Prepare for the interviews only if applicable.</p>

                <h2><b>Part-time Work Options for Students</b></h2>

                <p>Management of expenses in the UK&nbsp; can be really difficult at times for international students, especially when the city and the environment they are living in are more expensive than those in their home country.</p>

                <p>
                    This is why most international students choose to work part-time during weekends and during their post-study hours on weekdays. While a part-time job enables international students to be more independent, the certifications received
                    after the completion of the part-time work also help students get good work opportunities in the future.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Many universities and colleges recommend international students work only a maximum of 15 hours per week to maintain a study-life balance. Part-time jobs are the best way for international students in the UK to manage their expenses and
                    also gain valuable experience.&nbsp;
                </p>
