            <h2>City-wise Cost of Studying in Australia </h2>
            <p>
                When listing Australian universities, applicants must always check out the Australian cities, location, and their cost of living in Australia. While some Australian cities can be expensive, others will be affordable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Canberra, which is also the capital city of Australia, is the most costly city, and Darwin is the most inexpensive city in Australia. So, applicants who do not wish to spend much on living expenses can shortlist universities accordingly. Since Australia has some of the maximum footfall in its Melbourne and Sydney universities, it is important to consider the cost of living in Australia when deciding.
            </p>

            <p>
                An individual requires a new visa if they wish to stay and work part-time while studying in Australia upon completion of studies. After completing a Bachelor’s, Master’s, or doctoral degree, an individual is eligible for post-study work in Australia for the temporary Graduate (subclass 485) visa stream. In many cases, the employer also sponsors the new visa.
            </p>
            <p>
                After availing of the Australia student visa (subclass 500), students can work part-time while studying in Australia in any field during their stay. They can work 20 hours a week during their term classes. During breaks, international students can work for unlimited hours in Australia. However, research and PhD students can work part-time for unlimited hours during their research period.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recently, the government of Australia has permitted international students to work even before the commencement of the course. International students get to work with the best brands in the market that can help them advance their careers. With part-time work while studying in Australia, international students can earn an average hourly pay of AUD 34.64.

            <p>
                Australia has launched new measures for temporary graduate visas (TGV) for international students. Graduate visas are provided to former Australian student visa holders, offering international students full work rights and allowing them to gain work experience while they study in Australia.
            </p>
            <p>
                The work rights are also extended up to 6 years for international students who want to <b>study in Australia</b>. Students do not need a job offer to apply for post-study work in Australia.
