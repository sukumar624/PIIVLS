                <h2>Tuition Fee and Other Expenses for Students</h2>

                <p>
                    It is a well-known fact that the USA is the most popular and the most common choice for international students because of the country's excellent reputation in education and the presence of such prestigious and highly acclaimed
                    universities. However, it is essential to account for factors like college fees when<Link> studying in the USA</Link> as an international student.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Tuition fees account for a major component determining the overall cost of studying in the USA. The public or the state-owned universities are generally more affordable and cheaper than private institutions. International students who
                    are studying in the US can expect annual costs or expenses ranging from $25,000 - $45,000 to cover tuition and living costs.
                </p>
