                <h2>Germany self-employment visa</h2>
                <p>
                    A self-employment visa in Germany, which is also known as “Entrepreneurial visa” or “Visa for setting up a business”, allows non-EEA foreign nationals to start their businesses or work as a freelancer in the country. In Germany and the EU, the visa can lead to citizenship and permanent residence. A self-employment visa or residency permit may be granted for a maximum of three years. The residence permit may be extended if your business plan is successful and you are able to support your family's living expenses.
