                <h2>Application Process</h2>
                <p>
                    Your application is examined by an independent expert panel based on your business strategy. If the panel approves your business plan, you can apply for a self-employed entrepreneur residence and work permit. The permit is valid for up to two years, with the option of extending it for up to three years at a time.
                </p>
                <br />
                <h2>Processing Time</h2>
                <p>
                    This business visa takes one month to process and requires a minimum investment of €100,000 in one of several Danish sectors including cleantech, research and technology, real estate and construction.
                </p>
                <h2>Benefits of the Program</h2>
                <p>
                    As a permit holder under the Start-up Denmark program, you will be able to live in Denmark and travel to other Schengen countries. If some extra requirements are completed, permanent residence can be granted in 6 or 4 years. To preserve their re-entry permission, however, permit holders must not stay abroad for more than 6 months on a continuous basis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After 5 years of continuous residence, holders of the Denmark Golden Visa are eligible for permanent residency, and after 9 years of continuous residence, they can apply for Danish citizenship.
                </p>

                                        Startup Denmark is for startups that are both innovative and scalable, with a clear path to success. This means that restaurants, retail stores, and small import/export firms will typically be rejected before being evaluated and so will not be offered to the Startup Denmark expert panel.

                                        No, only accepted applicants are granted residency and work permits by Startup Denmark. Entrepreneurs are solely responsible for raising all necessary funds and must be financially self-sufficient. Start-ups in Denmark, on the other hand, are allowed to apply for a variety of governmental and private funding initiatives. We’ll leave it up to you to take advantage of the many possibilities.
