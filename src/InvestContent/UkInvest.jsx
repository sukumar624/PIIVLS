                                    The processing time for a decision is around 3 weeks. However, because you must first have a business plan in place and then get your idea endorsed, the entire preparation process may take longer. The innovator visa is granted for a period of three years and can be renewed for another three years an unlimited number of times.

You accomplish this by having it evaluated first and then endorsed by a relevant body. Anyone evaluating your proposal would benefit greatly from a business strategy. There is a list on the website.
