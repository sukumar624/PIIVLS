            <p>
                The United Kingdom has opened its doors for investors and entrepreneurs to set up businesses and settle in the UK. The <strong>UK Innovator Founder Visa</strong> category is usually for experienced business people to set up an innovative business. This visa allows you to stay in the UK with your family for up to 5 years and 4 months. You can apply for permanent settlement (Indefinite Leave to Remain) after completing 5 years in the UK. PIIVLS can help you plan and manage your investment journey in order to minimize risk and take full advantage of this program.

                                    The processing time for a decision is around 3 weeks. However, because you must first have a business plan in place and then get your idea endorsed, the entire preparation process may take longer. The innovator visa is granted for a period of three years and can be renewed for another three years an unlimited number of times.

You accomplish this by having it evaluated first and then endorsed by a relevant body. Anyone evaluating your proposal would benefit greatly from a business strategy. There is a list on the website.
