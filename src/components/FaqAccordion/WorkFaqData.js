        question: "How do I get a work visa?",
        answer: `
            A Work Visa allows you to legally work in a certain country for a specific period of time. <br />
            Most countries require you to have a job offer from that country before you apply for a Work Visa. The Company which has given you the job offer also needs to sponsor your Visa. You may also be required to have a positive Labour Market Test before you apply for the same. <br />
            Hence, to get a Work Visa you must first meet the eligibility requirements of the Visa specified by the particular country.

        question: "Which countries are easy to get a work visa?",
        answer: `
            A Work Visa is essentially a work permit that allows you to enter a foreign country and legally work there for a certain period of time. <br />
            Different countries have different eligibility requirements and procedures for a Work Permit.<br />
            Some countries require you to have a job offer in the country before you can apply for a Work Visa. You are also required to be sponsored by the Company which has given you the job offer. <br /> Some countries allow you to enter on a Tourist or Business Visa. You may then apply for a Work Visa once you have obtained a job offer in the country. <br /> Again, there are certain countries which allow you to apply for a Job-Seeker Visa. You may enter the country on this and then apply for a Work Visa once you get a job offer. <br />
            Thus, it is not possible to point out the countries where it is “easy” to get a Work Visa. <br /> The ease of getting a Work Visa depends on a number of conditions like the country, eligibility requirements etc. <br /> If you meet all the eligibility requirements of the Work Visa of a particular country, then you may be able to obtain a Work Visa.`,

        question: "How much is a work visa?",

        question: "How long does it take to get a working visa?",
        answer: `
           The processing time for a Work Visa depends on the country as different countries have different processing times. It also depends on the country that you are applying the visa from.< br />

        question: "What does it take to get a work visa?",
        answer: `
           Most countries offer Work Visas to meet the labour shortage in their country. Often employers find it difficult to fill a particular job locally as they cannot find the required skills in their country. This generally happens with high-skilled as well as trades jobs. < br />
            You should have the necessary skills that are in demand in a particular country to get a Work Visa. You should also have the necessary educational qualifications and any certifications that may be needed for the job. You should also have the necessary work experience required for the job. <br /> Some countries may also require you to take a Language Proficiency Test. This is particularly true for English-speaking countries where you may need to take an English Test like IELTS before applying for a Work Visa.

        question: "What would you suggest I do first, get a job or apply for the work permit / PR?",
        answer: `
          To deal with the talent shortage in their respective countries, many countries offer PR to foreign skilled professionals. PR gives you the status of a local and greatly improves the chances of you finding a job. Also, with a PR, you do not require employer sponsorship. < br />
           On the other hand, a work permit is for a limited time only and is contract-based as well.<br /> While individual circumstances might differ from person to person, a PR status usually provides you better returns as compared to a work permit
